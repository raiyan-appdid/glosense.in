            <p class="my-10 md:text-xl">We all go through ups and downs in life, right? Well, so do our hormones. Pregnancy,
                menopause, health issues, you name it – they can all mess with your hormones, and your hair. Seriously,
                those little guys have a lot to say about your hair growth cycle. Mess with their balance, and you could be
                saying goodbye to your lovely locks. So, it's not just about hair; it's about keeping your body's harmony to
                keep your hair looking fab.

            <p class="text-xl md:text-3xl font-bold my-10">Different Strokes for Different Folks:
            </p>
            <p class="my-10 md:text-xl">Hormonal hair loss isn't a one-size-fits-all kinda deal. It comes in different
                flavours, each with its own set of quirks. Understanding these types is like having a secret weapon against
                hair loss. There's Androgenetic Alopecia, Telogen Effluvium, Alopecia Areata – you name it! They're like the
                X-Men of hair loss. Knowing which one you're dealing with helps you fight back like a superhero, whether
                you're a man, woman, or someone battling the effects of PCOS.

            </p>
            <p class="my-10 md:text-xl">You know what's rarely mentioned in the hair loss talks? The emotional rollercoaster
                it puts you on. It's not just about losing hair; it's about how you feel about it. The toll it takes on your
                self-esteem and self-confidence can be pretty heavy. So, we're here to say it's okay to feel that way. And
                you know what? You're not alone. There's an army of folks who've been through it, and they're ready to
                support you, regardless of your gender or your PCOS journey.
